# Golang webserver for serving webpages

### intro
This project was set up to create a simple golang backend to serve html with a database for persistance. 
Run docker compose up to boot the project. 
The website will be serverd on http://localhost:8080

The golang app is served with Air for hot reloading on changes. 
The frontend still needs to be refreshed though, since it's static html.
